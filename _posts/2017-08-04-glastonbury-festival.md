‘This is Glastonbury’, a Frome FM special joining Alex Hawkins in a series of programmes delving into the creative work behind the scenes that make Glastonbury Festival such a unique place to be. Capturing the soundscapes, moments, feelings and personal perspectives from one of the largest festivals in the world.

We hear from the creators of the Kidz Field before the festival opens to the public, alongside interviews with poet Toria Garbutt, musicians Kathryn Williams, Michele Stodart, Marika Hackman, Blaenavon, music producer Russ Russell and organisations such as Deaf Zone whose volunteer interpreters increase access for all to festival life.
