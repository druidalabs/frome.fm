        <title>Angular 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Angular computes updates based on changes to data, not DOM, for fast updates that scale to the largest data sets with minimal memory overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Angular Universal for server-side rendering and Web Workers for smooth scrolling and transitions, Angular 2 solves the core challenges in mobile web performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supports several languages including plain JavaScript, TypeScript, and Dart. Also supports both object-style data structure with POJO data-binding and functional reactive style with unidirectional data flow and support for observables and immutable data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular is built by a team of engineers who share a passion for making web development feel effortless. We believe that writing beautiful apps should be joyful and fun. We’re building a platform for the future….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more come along to my event!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rebellious Jukebox</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So what is there for a music show to rebel against? Well, possibly the mediocre, possibly the manufactured; certainly the mundane. There are no rules here: a particular show is just as likely to be influenced by a weekend at WOMAD or the Cambridge Folk Festival, as by memories of listening to John Peel or Tommy Vance back in the early eighties. Julian moved to Frome in 2015: “One of the best things I’ve ever done.” Music, beer and bicycles are top of the hobbies list and there are ample opportunities to indulge in all three here. He bought his first album in 1980; AC/DC’s Highway to Hell; still a favourite, and has been collecting music ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the Rebellious Jukebox: every show aims to be a deluge of musical diversity and excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
