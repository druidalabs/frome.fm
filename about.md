# Transition - where are we going

The way people consume radio these days is shifting to a new paradigm. People tend to consume customised content on demand, rather than tunning into radio programs at specific times and dates like it used to be.

With the advent of internet and devices able to consume multimedia we believe that the radio experience could be way richer than just listening to an audio in a given dial. 

We want to run the radio online as a transparent open source project maintained by its contributors.

By using this innovative approach we believe we enable the transition so the radio becomes a rich resource serving its community.

[Frome FM](https://github.com/druidalabs/frome.fm) is free to use open source Jekyll project based on [Evento's Jekill template](https://github.com/boyney123/evento)

Come and join us to re-shape the radio industry!
