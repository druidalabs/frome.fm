 Discovering intimate gigs from passionate musicians and other random events


Because we don’t want a music “industry”; music deserves better than that!

We believe artists want to bring in a steady, reliable income, all year round, from doing what they love - playing original music to passionate audiences in intimate settings.

In just the way that the artisan markets support the crafts community, and the farmers market supports local producers, Frome FM in partnership with [HaveFunHub](https://havefunhub.com) can support small, independent artist and musicians.

If you like to support the ‘little guy’, prefer small gigs and quirky, one-off venues to chains and major acts, this is your platform.
